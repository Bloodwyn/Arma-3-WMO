# Arma-3-WMO
Arma 3 "WMO - Walkable Moving Objects" debug version.

This Addons makes you be able to walk on driving vehicles without sliding off.

I highly recommend BadBensons Enhanced Movement to be able to climb ontop of the vehicles. But it is optional.

 

Notes:
- Every type of vehicle works, but with high speeds, you migth slide off
- Addon is only script based, so the experience migth be glichy in some cases :-)
- Scripts need to run on each frame so you will experience a decrease of perfomance
- Does work in MP, but doesn`t look smooth for other players
- Only the players who want to use WMO need to have the mod loaded
- If you want to ride an object that is not in "vehicles" you can add it to the WMO_specialObjects array
